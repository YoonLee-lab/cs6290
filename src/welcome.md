# Welcome

This notebook contains my personal notes for CS6290: High Performance Computer
Architecture offered at the Georgia Institute of Technology. A summary of the
course follows:

This course covers modern computer architecture, including branch prediction,
out-of-order instruction execution, cache optimizations, multi-level caches,
memory and storage, cache coherence and consistency, and multi- and many-core
processors.
