# Virtual Memory

This lesson discusses the difference between virtual and physical memory.
Virtual memory is used by programs and must be translated to physical memory.
Since the translation can be slow, a Translation LookÂ­Aside Buffer (TLB) is used.
The notes for this lesson can be found [here](./pdf/Lesson13Notes.pdf).

## Page Size Quiz

Below is a quiz from the lectures that has us calculate the number of physical
memory frames for a system and then the number of page table entries for each
process.

## Virtual to Physical Translation Quiz

The below quiz from the lectures demonstrates how to calculate the number of
cycles necessary necessary to conduct virtual to physical address translation.

The below quiz from the lectures demonstrates the same as above except the page
table entries are cached.

## TLB Size Quiz

Below is a quiz from the lectures covering how we can calculate the approx.
size of the TLB to achieve similar performance to the cache.
